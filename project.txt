each bug: 
	title
	Description of the defect
	The minimal steps necessary to reproduce the defect
	Environment (what browser, etc.)
	Expected results
	Who the bug is assigned to
	The priority or severity of the bug
	The associated project/release/version
	Attach files (screenshots, etc)
	
	Organize
	- by project, version, or release of the software
	Levels of access. 
	- Will some people have limited access to certain bugs or fields?
	
	
How are bugs assigned, prioritized and scheduled?
How should a bug move through your organization, 
	e.g., is there a set path that your bug must take from step to step?
Will a defect be able to move from ‘Found’ to ‘Fixed’ directly, 
	or should it pass through a ‘Testing’ phase first?
Are there any rules you would like to tie to certain steps of your bug tracking process?
Would you like to receive an email notification if a defect reaches a certain step? 
	Notifications are a great way to make sure the right people know when a bug is created, 
	moved to a new workflow step, fixed, etc.
